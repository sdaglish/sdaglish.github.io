title: "STM32 Wireless Temperature Sensor - First PCB Prototype"
---

It's been quite a while since I did any update on this project. I've been using the old perfboard prototype sensor since August 2020, and so far, I've had to change the batteries once (though I think that the batteries I put in first were nowhere near full when they were installed).

Since then, I've designed and had manufactured the first set of PCBs, and I've done very little with them for far too long! The current system works and I was a bit too scared that I'd stop it from working, right in the middle of Winter. However, things are starting to warm up here in the UK, so I've started to look into this again.
